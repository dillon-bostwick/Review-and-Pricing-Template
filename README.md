# Tile-Review-and-Pricing-Template
I wrote this algorithm in 2013 when I was working at the startup Brightwater Homes. The algorithm pulls data from financial statements (exported from QuickBooks) and helps the customer choose which tile styles fit within their budget for their custom-designed home, and computes an estimate for use by the accountant.

I'm putting this repo up to show some earlier work I made when I was first teaching myself. (I only chose to learn VBA because it made it easiest for the accountant and customer rep to work directly through Excel).
